    It means we have to find the paths which will be unique in a column ans row diagonally too.
    like if there is a matrix of n*n then , in question it will be given that find n queens
    for ex for 3*3 matrix find 3 queens
       N * *
       * * N
       * N *

      The dimension of matrix will be equals to number of queens.
